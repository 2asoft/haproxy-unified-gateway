## HTTP Echo docker image

### Building the `http-echo` Docker Image

This example requires the **http-echo** Docker image, which is used as a simple backend application for testing TLS passthrough and HTTP routing.

The source code for the image is located in the HAProxy Unified Gateway repository:

[https://github.com/haproxytech/haproxy-unified-gateway](https://github.com/haproxytech/haproxy-unified-gateway)

#### Steps to build the image

1. Clone the repository (or navigate to the folder if you already have it):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/haproxytech/haproxy-unified-gateway
cd haproxy-unified-gateway/ci/http-echo
```

2. Build the Docker image

```sh
docker build -t http-echo:latest .
```

3. Make the image available to your Kubernetes cluster

* Option 1: Push to a Docker registry accessible from the cluster:

```bash
docker tag http-echo:latest <your-registry>/http-echo:latest
docker push <your-registry>/http-echo:latest
```

* Option 2: Load the image into a Kind cluster (if you are using Kind)

```sh
kind load docker-image http-echo:latest --name <kind-cluster-name>
```

After the image is available in your cluster, you can apply the example manifests, and the TLSRoute/HTTPRoute examples will use this image as the backend.
